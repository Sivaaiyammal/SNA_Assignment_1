# Assignment 1 (Whitepace)

## Description
This is my first project, where I have used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build a responsive webpage. The layout automatically adjusts based on the screen size, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. 

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Sivaaiyammal/SNA_Assignment_1.git

## Usage
To run this project, you only need a web browser with an active internet connection because it uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome via CDN.
### Steps to Run
1. Download or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Sivaaiyammal/SNA_Assignment_1.git   
2. Open the project folder.
3. Double-click on **index.html** or open it in a web browser.
